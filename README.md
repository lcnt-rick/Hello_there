- 👋 Hi, I’m @lcnt-rick
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain and therefore is necesary to understand how programing/codes work so I can take better business decisions and work more efficiently with my dev-ops. team in order to achieve set goals and greater than expected results.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming on the most popular languages, but I'm looking to be skilled in coding in the blockchain. I have already theoretical knowledge and experience, but the goal is to be able to read/write(partially) a code, so I can analyze and develop with a team innovative use/business cases with an integral perspective, and bring them to market.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate mostly on initiatives on the blockchain, but also willing to help develop ideas to accomplish and deploy ready-to-market products.
